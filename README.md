# IAGO: a javascript othello web app

<i>"I follow him to serve my turn upon him.<br>
We cannot all be masters, nor all masters<br>
Cannot be truly followed."</i>

## Description 

First developed for iOS in 2020 out of a pandemic hobby by a self-taught coder-by-evening/lawyer-by-day, Iago is now a javascript web app (where developers are free!). 

The robot "analyzes" the current board position with conditional logic without look ahead at potenetial moves, but is surprisingly able to outperforming small children.

Iago provides gameplay options of human v. human, human v. robot, or (look out!) robot v. robot. Iago has multiple features including a new game button, a back button, and the ability to convert either player to robot or human mid-game.
